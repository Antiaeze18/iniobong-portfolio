                    <h2>The History of Fashion: An Overview</h2>
                    In spite of its rich and long history, fashion is widely perceived as a trivial and commercial pursuit. People have used fashion for generations to make political remarks, express themselves, and promote their status.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Furthermore, plain wool or linen tunics were worn by individuals in the past. Jewelry or needlework was used to beautify the clothing of the rich citizens. After some time, a unique dress code was created by various cultures. For instance, the low-class wore simple tunics while elites wore magnificent robes in medieval Europe.

                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <p><span><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i></span> More so, a new style of clothing that was well-fitted and tighter than the usual was introduced by the rich Italians during the Renaissance. This new style was referred to as fashionable clothing which spread across Europe. Also, an essential aspect of European culture in the 1600s saw the emergence of fashion. <span><i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i></span></p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, the fashion industry developed further over the years. Designs evolved as new materials and silhouettes were created. However, one thing didn’t change: fashion has never only been about clothes. It was all about how you want the world to perceive you and portraying who you are.

                <p>
                    <h3>The Different Types of Fashion</h3>
                    Typically, in footwear, furniture, clothing, makeup, accessories, body piercing, fashion is a common habit or style. Simply put, the ongoing trend in how people express themselves in a unique manner is termed fashion.
                    Also, a social class, ethnicity, political party, nation generation, occupation can be connected to a style of clothing. At different periods, distinctive styles are linked with specific places. For instance, in New York City and London from the mid-to-early 1970s, punk fashion was introduced.
